# Data-Visualization-Practice (In Progress)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Eric Matthes project-based programming book titled "Python Crash Course", This repository is used solely as a (practice) guide to hone my data analytics skills.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you will find several data visualization techniques ranging from basic line graphs to advanced-artsy charts. This repository will also be used in my future projects as I dive deeper into data sciences.

### Part 1: Linegraphs

This portion of the data visualization section was quite short as it served as an introduction to the rest of the chapter.
