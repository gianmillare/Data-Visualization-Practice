# Data-Visualization-Practice (In Progress)

From Eric Matthes project-based programming book titled "Python Crash Course", this repository is used solely as a (practice) guide to hone my Python Programming and Data Analytics skills.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you will find several data visualization techniques ranging from basic line graphs to advanced-artsy charts. Please note that not all graphs are shown below. The rest are located in the "plots" folder. 

This repository will also be used in my future projects as I dive deeper into data sciences. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Part 1: Linegraphs

This portion of the data visualization section was quite short as it served as an introduction to the rest of the chapter.

### Part 2: Scatter-Series Plots

This section shows a series of points after writing a line of code that calculates data automatically by squaring and cubing values. At the end of this section, I implement Color Maps to show a gradient change in the data.

### Part 3: Random Walk (Scatter Plots)

Using the Random and Choice libraries in Python, the charts you see below are a progression of the first scatter plots created to the last, as each chart became increasingly more artistic and contained more and more data.

Here I added markers to show where the walk started and ended

This plot uses ten times more data than the previous plots. Decreasing point size gives the plot a more cloud-like appearnance.

### Part 4: Rolling Dice with Plotly

Using Plotly, I visualized the probability of a rolling a specific side of a die. Below is an image of rolling a single die.

As I advanced further into more mathematical concepts, I added another die. Rolling two D6 dice imaged below.

Finally, I alter the code a bit to visualize the probability of rolling a value using two different (D6 and D10) sized dice.
